/**
 * This is a series of Kotlin tricks.
 *
 * In this Kata you should implement three fundamental functions:
 *
 * unless (the opposite of if)
 * until (the opposite of while)
 * forceRun (whatever happens (exceptions? errors?), just make it continue)
 * The example tests are nearly the same as the final tests(just some more robust tests). This is why I provide such
 * poor initial solution.
