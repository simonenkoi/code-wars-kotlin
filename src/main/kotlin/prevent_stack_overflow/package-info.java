/**
 * This is a series of Kotlin tricks.

 * As we all know, there're two ways to implement loops. while/for and recursion.
 *
 * You're expected to use recursion. So you're not allowed to write while/for/all/none/any/Each/map/filter.
 *
 * A function is given. It's using recursion. But the test case make it cases StackOverflowError.
 *
 * Please do something to prevent it from raising an error.
