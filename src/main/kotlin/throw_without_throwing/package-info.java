/**
 * In this kata, you'll have to throw some Exceptions, but throwing an exception is so easy, so your code shouldn't
 * contain the following substrings:
 * <p>
 * Class
 * Exception
 * Error
 * Throwable
 * throw
 * Which means, you cannot use the reflection API or use new to create Exception instances.
 * <p>
 * You have to implement some static methods, and the name of each method tells you which Exception you're expected to
 * throw in that method.
 * <p>
 * Have fun!
