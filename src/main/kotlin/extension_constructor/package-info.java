/**
 * This is a series of Kotlin tricks.
 *
 * As we all know, Kotlin supports something called extension methods, which means you can add some methods to some
 * existing classes.
 *
 * In this Kata, you should make some extension constructor. For example, you can add a constructor to kotlin.Int that
 * accepts a String and parse the string to int.
 *
 * You should add such extension constructor to kotlin.Int, kotlin.Long, kotlin.Double.
